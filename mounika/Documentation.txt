    <h2><b><a id="target">Women Empowerment</a></b></h2>

    <p style="color:red">Women's empowerment is the process of empowering women. [1][2] Empowerment can be defined in many ways, however, when talking about women's empowerment, empowerment means accepting and allowing people (women) who are on the outside of the decision-making process into it.it is the process for women to redefine gender roles that allows them to acquire the ability to choose between known alternatives whom have otherwise been restricted from such an ability.</p>

    <p> Empowerment is the process that creates power in individuals over their own lives, society, and in their communities. People are empowered when they are able to access the opportunities available to them without limitations and restrictions such as in education, profession and lifestyle. Feeling entitled to make your own decisions creates a sense of empowerment. Empowerment includes the action of raising the status of women through education, raising awareness, literacy, and training. Women's empowerment is all about equipping and allowing women to make life-determining decisions through the different problems in society.</p>

    <p style="color:blue">Women empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in development and economics. It can also point to the approaches regarding other trivialized genders in a particular political or social context.</p>

    <p><mark>Women's economic empowerment refers to the ability for women to enjoy their right to control and benefit from the resources, assets, income and their own time, as well as the ability to manage risk and improve their economic status and well being.</mark></p>

    <p>Women Empowerment <sub>Entire nations, businesses, communities and groups can benefit from the implementation of programs and policies that adopt the notion of women empowerment.[7] Empowerment of women is a necessity for the very development of a society, since it enhances both the quality and the quantity of human resources available for development.[8] Empowerment is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing human rights and development.</sub></p>

    <p>Women Empowerment<sup>Women's empowerment and achieving gender equality is essential for our society to ensure the sustainable development of the country. Many world leaders and scholars have argued that sustainable development is impossible without gender equality and women's empowerment. </sup></p>

        <h2><b><a id="target1">Role of Education</a></b></h2>

        <p>It is said that education increases "people's self-confidence and also enables them to find better jobs and they can work shoulder to shoulder with men".[citation needed] They engage in public debate and make demands on government for health care, social security and other entitlements".[.</p>

        <p> In particular, education empowers women to make choices that improve their children's health, their well-being, and chances of survival.[35][34] Education informs others of preventing and containing the disease, and it is an essential element of efforts to reduce malnutrition.</p>

        <p style="color: wheat;">Furthermore, it empowers women to make choices that can improve their welfare, including marrying beyond childhood and having fewer children. Crucially, education can increase women's awareness of their rights, boost their self-esteem, and provide them the opportunity to assert their rights.</p>





        <h2><b><a id="target2">The Internet use to empower Women</a></b></h2>

        <p>The growing access of the web in the late 20th century has allowed women to empower themselves by using various tools on the Internet. With the introduction of the World Wide Web, women have begun to use social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter for online activism.[29] Through online activism, women are able to empower themselves by organizing campaigns and voicing their opinions for equality rights without feeling oppressed by members of society.</p>

        <p>In recent years, blogging has also become a powerful tool for the educational empowerment of women. According to a study done by the University of California, Los Angeles, medical patients who read and write about their disease are often in a much happier mood and more knowledgeable than those who do not.By reading others' experiences, patients can better educate themselves and apply strategies that their fellow bloggers suggest.</p>
        <p>With the easy accessibility and affordability of e-learning (electronic learning), women can now study from the comfort of their homes.[41] By empowering themselves educationally through new technologies like e-learning, women are also learning new skills that will come in handy in today's advancing globalized world.</p>


        <h2><b><a id="target3">Economic Enpowerment</a></b></h2>

        <p>

            Economic empowerment increases women's agency, access to formal government programs, mobility outside the home, economic independence, and purchasing power. Policy makers are suggested to support job training to aid in entrance in the formal markets.[11] One recommendation is to provide more formal education opportunities for women that would allow for higher bargaining power in the home. They would have more access to higher wages outside the home; and as a result, make it easier for women to get a job in the market.

        <p>Another popular methodology for women's economic empowerment also includes microcredit.[16] Microfinance institutions aim to empower women in their community by giving them access to loans that have low interest rates without the requirement of collateral.[17] More specifically, they(microfinance institutions) aim to give microcredit to women who want to be entrepreneurs.</p>

        <p><i> When talking about women's empowerment, many scholars suggest examining the social injustices on women in everyday organizational life that are influenced by race, class, and gender.</i></p>
