    <h2><b>Women<sup>Empowerment</sup></b></h2>

    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Women's empowerment<sub>is the proces</sub> s of empowering women. Empowerment can be defined in many ways, however, when talking about women's empowerment, empowerment means accepting and allowing people (women) who are on the outside of the decision-making
        process into it.it is the process for women to redefine gender roles that allows them to acquire the ability to choose between known alternatives whom have otherwise been restricted from such an ability.</p>

    <h2 style="color: darkslateblue;"><i>The Internet use to empower Women</i></h2>

    <p><b>The growing access of the web in the late 20th century has allowed 
    women to empower themselves by using various tools on the Internet. 
    With the introduction of the World Wide Web, women have begun to use 
    social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter for online activism.
    Through online activism, women are able to empower themselves by 
    organizing campaigns and voicing their opinions for equality rights 
    without feeling oppressed by members of society.</b></p>

    <p>In recent years, blogging has also become a powerful tool for the educational empowerment of women. According to a study done by the University of California, Los Angeles, medical patients who read and write about their disease are often in a much
        happier mood and more knowledgeable than those who do not.By reading others' experiences, patients can better educate themselves and apply strategies that their fellow bloggers suggest.</p>

    <h2 style="color: darkviolet; font-size: xx-large;font-family: fantasy;"><b>Economic Enpowerment</b></h2>

    <p>Economic empowerment increases women's agency, access to formal government programs, mobility outside the home, economic independence, and purchasing power. Policy makers are suggested to support job training to aid in entrance in the formal markets.
        One recommendation is to provide more formal education opportunities for women that would allow for higher bargaining power in the home. They would have more access to higher wages outside the home; and as a result, make it easier for women to
        get a job in the market.</p>
