    <h2><b><a id="target" style="color: darkslateblue;">Thunder Bay</a></b></h2>
    <p style="color:red;">Thunder Bay is Northwest Ontarios largest city and comprises nearly half the population of the entire area. With amazing art , music, film, and culinary scenes, Canada 's Greatest Outdoor City is also perfect for those not-so-outdoors. Thunder Bay
        has an international airport, great hotel and lodging options, making it the perfect base camp for all of your adventures in Northwest Ontario.</p>
    <p>Located on the shores of Lake Superior, the largest freshwater lake in the world, Thunder Bay also has unlimited opportunities for outdoor adventure right in the town. With winter skiing, snowshoeing, fat biking, and ice climbing, sailing, paddling,
        mountain biking, and more all summer months — Thunder Bay is truly Canada 's greatest outdoor city.</p>
    <p><b>History:</b>The European settlement at Thunder Bay began with two French fur trading posts (1683 and 1717) which were later abandoned. The North West Company based in Montreal founded Fort William as its mid-continent warehouse in 1803. The fort
        flourished until 1821 when the North West Company combined with the Hudson's Bay Company, and no longer needed Fort William. By the 1850s the Canadian province started to take an interest in its western extremity. Discovery of copper in Michigan's
        Keweenaw Peninsula had triggered domestic demand for mining locations on Lake Superior's Canadian shores. The Mission de l'Immaculée-Conception on the Kaministiquia was founded by French-speaking Jesuits in 1849 to evangelize the Ojibwe. In 1850
        the Government of Canada signed the Treaty of Robinson with the Lake Superior Ojibwa. As a result, an Indian reservation south of the Kaministiquia River was set aside for them. In 1859–60, two townships and Fort William Town Plot were surveyed
        by the Department of Crown Lands for European-Canadian settlement.</p>

        <p style="background-color: lightcoral;">The Sleeping Giant, visible from many places in Thunder Bay, is the most well-known natural wonder of the region. The landmass itself is an Ontario Park with hundreds of kilometers of enjoyable hiking trails and campsites.</p>
        <p>Numerous variants of the Sleeping Giant Legend are available, and one is not inherently more true than another. This particular one was published by Hubert Limbrick, a former Fort William City councillor (1951-58 and '60-65), in a booklet called

        <h2><b><a id="target2">Terry Fox</a></b></h2>
        <p>Sculptor Manfred Pervich built the statue to mark the place where on 31 August 1980 Fox was forced to abandon his sprint. However, it is not located at the exact spot where he finished the run, but it is about four kilometers farther west, the
            exact spot where Fox finished the run is only seen by a private marker not easily visible from the lane. The monument was dedicated by Governor General Edward Schreyer on 26 June 1982, just days before the first anniversary of the death of
            Terry Fox.</p>
        <p>The statue was originally located directly along the Highway route and was later relocated to a dedicated park overlooking the highway to accommodate the road widening.</p>

            Marina Park is a small waterfront park and marina located in Thunder Bay, Ontario on the shores of Lake Superior. The park is located in the north end of the city, near the north center of downtown. The park also has walking trails and a boardwalk, playground
            equipment, picnic tables, a Mariner's Monument and the historic CN Rail Station (now home to gift shops and ice cream parlor, restaurant and other amenities), as well as pleasure craft docks and a fueling facility. Often known as "King Arthur's
            Landing," the marina is in the first phase of a $130 million expansion. It is a public-private partnership to make the park tourist friendly and provide the town with a new tax base.
        </p>
        <p>It is a public-private partnership to make the park tourist friendly and provide the town with a new tax base. The private firm is in the process of building two seven-story towers, an art gallery and a hotel onto the marina with water park. The
            current area is infilled with an average of 3 acres (12,000 m2) for each pier to provide ample space for the new buildings. Some of the key attractions for the residential half of the building is a splash pad-rink that visitors and the residential
            will be able to use during the year. The project continued throughout the winter season, and the infill and other basic features were completed.</p>
        <p>Over several various funding programs the project was funded by all levels of government. Construction is expected to be finished in the fall of 2010, with the completion of minimal landscaping in 2011. Phase 2, which will see the area extended
            to an old industrial location, is currently in the design stages. The area would house a cruise ship landing and probably a conference center and create a vast area that will be freely open to everyone. Costs for a project like this are not
            yet understood. This project is scheduled to begin in 2011 or 2012, and is part of a much broader project that will ultimately build all 52 km of the waterfront of the city.</p>
