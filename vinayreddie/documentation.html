    <h2><b><a id="target">Thunder Bay</a></b></h2>
    <p>Thunder Bay is Northwest Ontario's largest city and comprises nearly half the population of the entire area. With amazing art , music, film, and culinary scenes, Canada 's Greatest Outdoor City is also perfect for those not-so-outdoors. Thunder Bay
        has an international airport, great hotel and lodging options, making it the perfect base camp for all of your adventures in Northwest Ontario.</p>
    <p>Located on the shores of Lake Superior, the largest freshwater lake in the world, Thunder Bay also has unlimited opportunities for outdoor adventure right in the town. With winter skiing, snowshoeing, fat biking, and ice climbing, sailing, paddling,
        mountain biking, and more all summer months â€” Thunder Bay is truly Canada 's greatest outdoor city.</p>

    <h2><b><a id="target1">Sleeping Gaint</a></b></h2>
    <p>The Sleeping Giant, visible from many places in Thunder Bay, is the most well-known natural wonder of the region. The landmass itself is an Ontario Park with hundreds of kilometers of enjoyable hiking trails and campsites.</p>
    <p>Numerous variants of the Sleeping Giant Legend are available, and one is not inherently more true than another. This particular one was published by Hubert Limbrick, a former Fort William City councillor (1951-58 and '60-65), in a booklet called Tales
        of The Tom Tom, possibly written in the 1950s or 1960s.</p>

    <h2><b><a id="target2">Terry Fox</a></b></h2>
    <p>Sculptor Manfred Pervich built the statue to mark the place where on 31 August 1980 Fox was forced to abandon his sprint. However, it is not located at the exact spot where he finished the run, but it is about four kilometers farther west, the exact
        spot where Fox finished the run is only seen by a private marker not easily visible from the lane. The monument was dedicated by Governor General Edward Schreyer on 26 June 1982, just days before the first anniversary of the death of Terry Fox.</p>
    <p>The statue was originally located directly along the Highway route and was later relocated to a dedicated park overlooking the highway to accommodate the road widening.</p>
