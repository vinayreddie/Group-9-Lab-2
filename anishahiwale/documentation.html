    <p>Hi, my name is Annie... I came in Thunderybay in Decemeber. Luckily till now i experienced three seasons here. During Decemeber, it snowed heavily here according to me, however, people staying here stays that this was the least snowfall for them.
        BUt yaa..!! Good for me. I celebrated Christmas and New Year here with my fellow roommates. Then comes the Spring season. Saw flowers growing no snowfall, melting of snow was totally a different experience for me. Still autumn is going on, in
        between there is rainfall sometimes and sometimes its bit hot because of direct sun, but yaa, as I am from India, I get very much happy when i see the Sunrays, but I am not that lucky as I can see the sunrays once in a bluemoon thing.
